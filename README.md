# Whitelisting plugin for Velocity

Uses permissions to manage whitelisting, so you need something like LuckPerms for this to work.

The following permissions are supported: 
 * `vwhitelist.toggle` - Allow toggling of whitelisting via `/vwhitelist on|off`
 * `vwhitelist.whitelisted` - Whitelist a player for access to all servers

It is currently not possible to manage which server a user can connect to at this point.
